GettingCleaningDataProject
==========================

By Su YANG

The repository contains the following files:
====================================================

- 'README.md'

- 'CodeBook.md': Explains the work done from raw data to submitted data and the variables in the end.

- 'features.txt': Gives the full names of the variables and its' relative order in the final dataframe.

- 'run_analysis.R': The R code that generates the disired clean data asked by the project.

- 'averagePerActivityAndPerSubject.txt': The output of the code in 'run_analysis.R' under .txt format with " " separator with header and no double quotes.

- 'UCI HAR Dataset': Which is technically a folder, it contains all the material from which the work is done. Especially the raw data.

Notes: 
======

- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

====================================================

See 'CodeBook.md' for further explanations of how the code works. Ensure that the working directory is the submitted directory.
Use setwd('path') with path the absolute path to the desired folder if not.
